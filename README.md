This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


**Technologies Used**
**Node.js:** Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's the foundation of our backend.

**Next:** Next.js is a React framework that allows you to create high-performance, scalable web sites and progressive web applications (PWAs). Next.js is based on React.

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWTs are used for user authentication. When a user logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which is then included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

## Axios
El backend utiliza PostgreSQL como base de datos para almacenar informaciÃ³n del usuario, datos de servicios y productos.

## Aos 
 It is composed of the user interface (UI), widgets, and animations. AOS animations are used to improve the user experience.

## Deployment
The Frontend is deployed on Vercel, Vercel is a cloud hosting platform for web applications and static websites.
